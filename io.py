                    the HDF5 file.

    Load data from a range of files containing equal shaped array data.

                         contain any number of "replacement fields" as defined
                         by the Python format string syntax. The field_name of
                         the replacement field can only be positional. For each
                         positional replacement field a range has to be given as
                         an additional argument to load_ranges function. 
    :param *args: Additional arguments containing the ranges for the replacement
                  fields within the given filename. The order in which ranges
                  have to be given is tied to the position of the replacement
                  field.
    :param **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments which are defined below.
    :param callable loader: A callable object that returns the array content
                            which is extracted from the file specified by the
                            filename given to the loader. If not given a LoadTXT
                            object is used to extract data from plain text
                            files.
    :param callable preprocess: A callable object that obtains the data loaded
                                from a single file. Any my do any operations on
                                the given data. The callable has to return the
                                result of the operations. The result should be
                                an numpy.array object. The shape of the returned
                                numpy.array object should be the same for all
                                given input data. Default: None.
